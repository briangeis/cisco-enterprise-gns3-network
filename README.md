## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Network Purpose and Scope

This repository presents the design and implementation of an enterprise-grade
network built using Cisco networking and security technologies. Constructed in
GNS3, the network demonstrates a layered, secure, and scalable architecture
that integrates core routing, switching, VLAN segmentation, redundancy,
security policy enforcement, and remote connectivity via site-to-site VPN.

Developed through a combination of real-world experience, CCNA coursework,
self-study, and hands-on experimentation with Cisco IOS and ASA platforms,
this project serves to showcase my ability to design, configure, and document
a complex network environment in alignment with industry best practices.

## 2. Network Architecture and Design

### 2.1 IP Addressing Scheme

The network uses private IPv4 address space for internal segmentation and
simulated public ranges to demonstrate external server access, internet
connectivity, and site-to-site VPN operations, with a scheme designed to
ensure segmentation, consistent subnetting, and scalability.

Point-to-point links use `/30` subnets for efficient utilization.
Main Site links range from `172.16.1.0/30` to `172.16.1.24/30`.
The Remote Site uses `172.16.2.0/30`.

User VLANs are assigned `/24` subnets for scalability and manageability.
Main Site VLANs reside in the `10.1.0.0/16` block.
Remote Site VLANs reside in the `10.2.0.0/16` block.
Each VLAN is assigned a network-aligned default gateway.

Public simulation ranges include `172.20.1.0/29` (Main Site),
`172.25.1.0/24` (Remote Site), and `172.30.1.0/24` (simulated external host).
These ranges are used to model NAT and internet access scenarios.

## 3. Implementation

This section outlines the implementation of the network design, organized
in a logical progression: starting with the network perimeter, followed by
internal sites, then the remote site, and concluding with the devices used
to validate external connectivity and verify security policies.

### 3.1 Edge Site (Network Perimeter)

The **Edge Site** serves as the network perimeter, functioning as the primary
gateway for internet access, external connectivity, and security enforcement.
The two components of this site are the `EDGE` Router and the Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance `ASA-MAIN`, which ensure controlled and secure
communication between internal and external networks.

#### ASA-MAIN

  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
    - Extended ACL applied to the `outside` interface to allow external
      HTTP/HTTPS and ICMP traffic to internal servers.
    - Crypto ACL to determine whether outbound traffic is routed via NAT/PAT
      or encapsulated in the site-to-site VPN tunnel.
  - **Stateful Inspection:** Ensures only legitimate, session-aware traffic
    is allowed through the perimeter.
  - **Site-to-Site IKEv2 VPN:** A secure, encrypted tunnel established with
    `ASA-REMOTE` using IP `172.20.1.2` to maintain confidentiality and

### 3.6 Network Device Hardening

In addition to their functional roles, all network devices have been
configured with security best practices in mind:

- **Switchport Security:**
  - All unused switchports have been manually shut down.
  - Switchports are configured by default as access ports and assigned to a
    non-routable VLAN to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential
    VLAN hopping attacks.
  - Access ports are configured to dynamically learn MAC addresses,
    permitting a total of two MAC addresses before a security violation occurs.
  - Access ports are configured to use PortFast and BPDU Guard to mitigate STP
    manipulation attacks.

- **Secure Remote Access:**
  - All devices are configured to allow SSH-only remote management.
  - SSH version 2 is enforced with strong encryption and authentication.
  - Access to VTY lines is restricted using ACLs that permit connections only
    from authorized NetAdmin networks.
  - Telnet access is explicitly disabled.

- **Unnecessary Services Disabled:**
  - Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is disabled on all devices to mitigate the
    potential exploitation of network infrastructure vulnerabilities.
  - HTTP and HTTPS server functions are disabled on all devices, as they are
    not required for network operation and pose a potential security risk if
    left enabled.
  - Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) is disabled on all switchports.

> [!NOTE]
> For demonstration and ease of review, the following non-secure settings
> have been intentionally configured:
> - Console and AUX port passwords have been disabled.
> - Privileged EXEC (enable) password has been disabled.
> - `exec-timeout` has been set to `0 0` to prevent session timeouts.
> - `privilege level` has been set to `15` to provide immediate access to
>   privileged EXEC mode.
>
> These configurations are **not suitable for production environments** and are
> applied solely to improve accessibility during evaluation.
