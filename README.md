## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Network Purpose and Scope

This repository presents the design and implementation of an enterprise-grade
network built using Cisco networking and security technologies. Constructed in
GNS3, the network demonstrates a layered, secure, and scalable architecture
that integrates core routing, switching, VLAN segmentation, redundancy,
security policy enforcement, and remote connectivity via site-to-site VPN.

Developed through a combination of real-world experience, CCNA coursework,
self-study, and hands-on experimentation with Cisco IOS and ASA platforms,
this project serves to showcase my ability to design, configure, and document
a complex network environment in alignment with industry best practices.

This repository is intended for technical professionals and hiring managers
seeking to evaluate my practical understanding of enterprise networking and
security principles. I invite you to explore the implementation details that
follow, which reflect both my technical proficiency and my commitment to

## 2. Network Architecture and Design

### 2.1 IP Addressing Scheme

The network uses private IPv4 address space for internal segmentation and
simulated public ranges to demonstrate external server access, internet
connectivity, and site-to-site VPN operations, with a scheme designed to
ensure segmentation, consistent subnetting, and scalability.

Point-to-point links use `/30` subnets for efficient utilization.
Main Site links range from `172.16.1.0/30` to `172.16.1.24/30`.
The Remote Site uses `172.16.2.0/30`.

User VLANs are assigned `/24` subnets for scalability and manageability.
Main Site VLANs reside in the `10.1.0.0/16` block.
Remote Site VLANs reside in the `10.2.0.0/16` block.
Each VLAN is assigned a network-aligned default gateway.

Public simulation ranges include `172.20.1.0/29` (Main Site),
`172.25.1.0/24` (Remote Site), and `172.30.1.0/24` (simulated external host).
These ranges are used to model NAT and internet access scenarios.

## 3. Implementation

This section outlines the implementation of the network design, organized
in a logical progression: starting with the network perimeter, followed by
internal sites, then the remote site, and concluding with the devices used
to validate external connectivity and verify security policies.

### 3.1 Edge Site (Network Perimeter)

#### Overview

The **Edge Site** serves as the network perimeter, functioning as the primary
gateway for internet access, external connectivity, and security enforcement.
The two components of this site are the `EDGE` Router and the Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance `ASA-MAIN`, which ensure controlled and secure
communication between internal and external networks.

#### ASA-MAIN

- **Role:** Acts as the primary network perimeter security device, enforcing
  security policies and controlling internal access to the remote site and
  the internet.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Network Address Translation (NAT/PAT):**
    - Static NAT for internal servers using IPs `172.20.1.3`–`172.20.1.5`.
    - Dynamic PAT for all internal hosts using IP `172.20.1.6`.
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
    - Extended ACL applied to the `outside` interface to allow external
      HTTP/HTTPS and ICMP traffic to internal servers.
    - Crypto ACL to determine whether outbound traffic is routed via NAT/PAT
      or encapsulated in the site-to-site VPN tunnel.
  - **Stateful Inspection:** Ensures only legitimate, session-aware traffic
    is allowed through the perimeter.
  - **Site-to-Site IKEv2 VPN:** A secure, encrypted tunnel established with
    `ASA-REMOTE` using IP `172.20.1.2` to maintain confidentiality and
    integrity of data transmitted between the main network and the remote site.

- **Connectivity:**
  - **Outside Interface:**
    Connected to the `CLOUD` Router for internet access.
  - **Inside Interface:**
    Connected to `EDGE` Router for internal network access.

#### EDGE Router

- **Role:** Serves as the central aggregation point for internal traffic,
  while also providing DHCP and NTP network services.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Default Route:** Configured to forward all external-bound traffic to
    `ASA-MAIN`.
  - **OSPF Routing:** Participates in the OSPF routing domain to ensure
    dynamic path selection and redundancy within the internal network.
  - **DHCP Server:** Provides dynamic IP address allocation to internal
    clients across the network.
  - **NTP Server:** Functions as the primary NTP master, synchronizing time
    across all network devices for consistency and accurate logging.

- **Connectivity:**
  - Connected to `ASA-MAIN` inside interface for internet access.
  - Connected to `SW-EDGE` for access to the Server Room.
  - Connected to `R1` and `R2` to facilitate internal site routing.

### 3.2 Main Site

#### Overview

The **Main Site** serves as the central operational hub of the network,
hosting end-user devices, departmental VLANs, and core connectivity to
internal and external services. The architecture incorporates redundancy
and segmentation through the use of multiple Layer 2 switches and dual
Layer 3 routers (`R1` and `R2`) to support inter-VLAN routing and failover
capabilities.

#### SW-FLOOR-1, SW-FLOOR-2, SW-FLOOR-3 (Layer 2 Switches)

- **Role:** Provide connectivity for end-user devices across multiple
  departments and physical floors.

- **Key Features:**
  - **VLAN Trunking:** Interfaces configured as trunks to carry traffic for
    multiple VLANs between switches.
  - **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP):** `SW-FLOOR-1` operates as the VTP server,
    with `SW-FLOOR-2` and `SW-FLOOR-3` configured as VTP clients to ensure
    consistent VLAN database synchronization.
  - **EtherChannel:** Trunk links between switches utilize LACP-based
    EtherChannel for increased bandwidth, redundancy, and fault tolerance.
  - **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Connected to `R2` for primary inter-VLAN routing,
    with a backup connection to `R1`.
  - **Rapid PVST+ Configuration:**
    - Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST+) enabled across all VLANs to prevent
      loops and ensure Layer 2 redundancy.
    - **Root Primaries:**
      - `SW-FLOOR-1`: VLANs 20 (NetAdmin), 30 (Sales)
      - `SW-FLOOR-2`: VLANs 40 (Marketing), 50 (Accounting)
      - `SW-FLOOR-3`: VLAN 60 (Management)
    - **Root Secondaries:**
      - `SW-FLOOR-1`: VLAN 60 (Management)
      - `SW-FLOOR-2`: VLANs 20 (NetAdmin), 30 (Sales)
      - `SW-FLOOR-3`: VLANs 40 (Marketing), 50 (Accounting)
    - Bridge priorities have been configured to ensure predictable election of
      root bridges during both normal operation and failover scenarios.

- **Connectivity:**
  - End-user devices connected via access ports assigned to specific VLANs.
  - Trunk links established between switches using EtherChannel.
  - `SW-FLOOR-1` connects to both `R2` and `R1` to ensure routing redundancy.

#### R1 (Layer 3 Router)

- **Role:** Primary router for `SW-WAREHOUSE` and backup inter-VLAN router
  for `SW-FLOOR-1`.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Configured with subinterfaces to support
    inter-VLAN communication.
  - **OSPF Routing:** Participates in the internal OSPF routing domain with
    an adjusted cost metric to prioritize traffic from `SW-WAREHOUSE`.
  - **HSRP Configuration:** Subinterfaces are configured with HSRP to
    provide redundancy for VLAN routing.

- **Connectivity:**
  - Connected to `EDGE` Router for access to core services and the internet.
  - Primary connection to `SW-WAREHOUSE` for warehouse VLAN traffic.
  - Backup connection to `SW-FLOOR-1` for inter-VLAN routing redundancy.

#### R2 (Layer 3 Router)

- **Role:** Primary inter-VLAN router for `SW-FLOOR-1` and backup router for
  `SW-WAREHOUSE`.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Configured with subinterfaces to support
    inter-VLAN communication.
  - **OSPF Routing:** Participates in the internal OSPF routing domain with
    an adjusted cost metric to prioritize traffic from `SW-FLOOR-1`.
  - **HSRP Configuration:** Subinterfaces are configured with HSRP to
    provide redundancy for VLAN routing, with priority and preemption enabled.

- **Connectivity:**

### 3.6 Network Device Hardening

In addition to their functional roles, all network devices have been
configured with security best practices in mind:

- **Switchport Security:**
  - All unused switchports have been manually shut down.
  - Switchports are configured by default as access ports and assigned to a
    non-routable VLAN to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate potential
    VLAN hopping attacks.
  - Access ports are configured to dynamically learn MAC addresses,
    permitting a total of two MAC addresses before a security violation occurs.
  - Access ports are configured to use PortFast and BPDU Guard to mitigate STP
    manipulation attacks.

- **Secure Remote Access:**
  - All devices are configured to allow SSH-only remote management.
  - SSH version 2 is enforced with strong encryption and authentication.
  - Access to VTY lines is restricted using ACLs that permit connections only
    from authorized NetAdmin networks.
  - Telnet access is explicitly disabled.

- **Unnecessary Services Disabled:**
  - Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is disabled on all devices to mitigate the
    potential exploitation of network infrastructure vulnerabilities.
  - HTTP and HTTPS server functions are disabled on all devices, as they are
    not required for network operation and pose a potential security risk if
    left enabled.
  - Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) is disabled on all switchports.

> [!NOTE]
> For demonstration and ease of review, the following non-secure settings
> have been intentionally configured:
> - Console and AUX port passwords have been disabled.
> - Privileged EXEC (enable) password has been disabled.
> - `exec-timeout` has been set to `0 0` to prevent session timeouts.
> - `privilege level` has been set to `15` to provide immediate access to
>   privileged EXEC mode.
>
> These configurations are **not suitable for production environments** and are
> applied solely to improve accessibility during evaluation.

## 4. Testing and Validation

This section validates the network’s core functionality through
four key tests: internal and external host connectivity, OSPF dynamic
routing behavior, and HSRP redundancy and failover. These tests
confirm that the network operates as designed, with proper routing,
access control, redundancy, and service availability.

### 4.1 Internal Host Connectivity

A Bash script is executed from each **internal end host** to verify:

| Test Type | Purpose                                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `ping`    | Confirm Layer 3 reachability between VLANs             |
| `curl`    | Verify HTTP access to internal servers                 |
| `dig`     | Validate DNS resolution using DHCP-assigned DNS server |

This script ensures that:
- Hosts are receiving full IP configuration (IP, gateway, DNS)
  via DHCP from `EDGE`
- VLAN segmentation and routing are functioning correctly
- Internal HTTP services are accessible from all internal VLANs
- The Site-to-Site VPN tunnel is active and supports inter-VLAN
  routing and DHCP services

#### Script Location

`scripts/internal-test.sh`

#### Results

Test results from all hosts are included in:  
`results/internal_connectivity_test_output.txt`

### 4.2 External Host Connectivity

A Bash script is executed from the **Web-Client (external host)** to verify:

| Test Type | Purpose                                                   |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `ping`    | Confirm ICMP reachability to internal servers             |
| `curl`    | Validate HTTP access to publicly exposed internal servers |

This script ensures that:
- Servers behind `ASA-MAIN` are accessible via **static NAT** and **ACLs**
- ICMP is explicitly allowed to internal servers only
- `ASA-MAIN` is enforcing **stateful inspection** and **access control**

#### Script Location

`scripts/external-test.sh`

#### Results

Test results are included in:  
`results/external_connectivity_test_output.txt`

### 4.3 OSPF Validation

This test validates the correct operation and redundancy behavior of the OSPF
routing protocol under both normal operation and device failure scenarios.
It confirms that OSPF neighbors form properly, routes are dynamically learned,
and the network converges appropriately when a path becomes unavailable.

#### Commands Used

```
show ip ospf neighbor
show ip route ospf
```

#### Validation Steps

1. Under normal network conditions, OSPF neighbor relationships and
  routing tables were captured from the three participating routers:
  `EDGE`, `R1`, and `R2`.
2. `R1` was administratively shut down to simulate a failure, and
  OSPF neighbor and route information was rechecked on `EDGE` and `R2`.  
3. After restoring `R1` to normal operation, `R2` was shut down,
  and the same OSPF verification steps were repeated on `EDGE` and `R1`.

This test confirms that:

- OSPF neighbors form correctly under normal conditions
- OSPF routes are dynamically learned and maintained across the network
- The network converges successfully during failure conditions
- Redundant paths are automatically selected and used when available

#### Results

All results are included in the following files:

- results/ospf_status_before.txt
- results/ospf_status_after_r1_down.txt
- results/ospf_status_after_r2_down.txt

### 4.4 HSRP Validation

This test validates the correct operation of HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
under both normal operation and router failure scenarios. The goal is to
confirm that HSRP is properly configured for first-hop redundancy, and that
failover occurs seamlessly when the active router becomes unavailable.

#### Commands Used

```
traceroute
show standby brief
```

#### Validation Steps

1. A traceroute was initiated from the end host `NetAdmin-PC` to the inside
  interface of `ASA-MAIN` to confirm that traffic was routed through `R2`,
  the designated active HSRP router under normal conditions.
2. The command `show standby brief` was executed on `R1`, the standby HSRP
  router, to verify its current standby status.
3. To simulate a failure, `R2` was administratively shut down.
4. The traceroute from step 1 was repeated to verify that traffic was now
  routed through `R1`, confirming HSRP failover.
5. The `show standby brief` command was executed again on `R1` to verify that
  it had transitioned from standby to active status.

This test confirms that:
- HSRP is configured and functioning correctly under normal conditions
- Failover occurs automatically and seamlessly when the active router
  becomes unavailable
- End hosts experience no disruption in connectivity during the transition
- The standby router assumes the virtual IP and begins forwarding traffic
  as expected

#### Results

All results are included in the following files:
- `results/hsrp_traceroute_before.txt`
- `results/hsrp_status_before.txt`
- `results/hsrp_traceroute_after.txt`
- `results/hsrp_status_after.txt`
